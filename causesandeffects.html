            <p>“Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and Clean Energy program at NRDC. “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution, smog, is then worsened by that increased heat, forming when the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change also increases the production of allergenic air pollutants, including mold (thanks to damp conditions caused by extreme weather and increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season).</p>

            <h2>Smog and Soot</h2>
            <div class="gap-15"></div>
            <p>These are the two most common forms of air pollution. Smog (also known as ground-level ozone) develops when emissions from burning fossil fuels react with sunlight. Soot (also known as particulate matter) is made up of microscopic particles of chemicals, dirt, smoke, dust, or allergies that are transported in the air as gas or solids. Smog and soot have similar origins. Both originate from automobiles and trucks, factories, power plants, incinerators, engines, and anything else that burns fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or natural gas. Smog may irritate the eyes and throat as well as harm the lungs, particularly those of youngsters, the elderly, and those who work or exercise outside. It's considerably worse for those who suffer from asthma.</p>

            <h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>
            <div class="gap-15"></div>
            <p>Greenhouse gas emissions have far-reaching environmental and health consequences. They contribute to respiratory problems due to smog and air pollution, and they affect climate change by trapping heat. Other implications of climate change produced by greenhouse gases include extreme weather, food supply shortages, and increasing wildfires. The weather patterns we've come to anticipate will alter; some species will go extinct, while others may relocate or grow.</p>
            <div class="gap-15"></div>
            <div class="gap-15"></div>
            <h2>Nitrogen Dioxide</h2>
            <div class="gap-15"></div>
            <p>Nitrogen dioxide levels that are too high can harm the human respiratory tract and increase a person's susceptibility to, and severity of, respiratory infections and asthma. Chronic lung disease can be caused by long-term exposure to high amounts of nitrogen dioxide. It may also have an effect on the senses, such as impairing a person's capacity to detect odours. High quantities of nitrogen dioxide are also hazardous to vegetation, causing damage to the leaves, slowing growth, and diminishing agricultural yields. Nitrogen dioxide has the ability to fade and discolour furniture and textiles, as well as limit visibility and react with surfaces.</p>
